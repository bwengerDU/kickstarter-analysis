# Deliverable 3: Written analysis of the results-Bryan Wenger.

## Overview of the project.

The Kickstarter challenge provides the opportunity to work through the process of taking raw data and transforming that information into graphic visuals to answer specific questions and to highlight detailed relationships amongst the data. 

### Delving into the details.

The initial elements of analyzing the raw data is to preview the data to gain an understanding of what the information is, the formatting of the information, and the various subjects that the data encompasses. Once this data is identified and the analyst has a feel for the information the next phase is to convert any information into more consumable data. This process may include breaking data into smaller and separate data categories while other tasks may be to convert one format of information into another style. 

### Asking the questions.

After the raw data has been converted into more consumable information the next phase is to understand the needs of the client. Communication and understanding of the client’s needs is critical as having this knowledge will direct how all further analysis will be performed. The most important phase is knowing how to extrapolate the answers needed from the data. Pivot tables and utilizing specified Excel functions are the main tools needed to extract specific data needed to answer client inquiries. 

### Showcasing the information. 

Converting these important findings and information into easily digestible visuals is the final and perhaps most important element of the project. Vast amounts of data are very difficult to understand when they are not presented in a concise, consistent, and correct methods. If an analyst is unable to effectively convey information to the client then their work will be fruitless. 

## Kickstarter Project.

### Project Overview.

The beginning of this project required survey of the Kickstarter data provided by the client to determine what information we were working with and to determine which elements of the data needed to be converted. Categories needed to be broken into Parent and Subcategories and timestamps needed to be converted into traditional short date formatting. Multiple columns were created to accommodate this new data and to then utilize various Excel formulas to create new data points such as Successful, Failed, and Canceled percentages. Debugging was required to clean up those formulas that lead to errors. The next phase was to utilize pivot tables in order to extrapolate specific data sets to answer the clients various requests. These tables were then used to create charts and graphs to provide the visual representations to these inquiries. 

### Challenges 

The largest challenge I faced was understanding how to shape and change the formatting and inputs involved in the Pivot Tables. It was very difficult to visualize how much of an impact it was to have “Outcomes” placed in the row filter versus how it would appear when placed in the column filter. I overcame this challenge by continually plugging in the various categories and seeing how these changes would flow through to the pivot table. This helped me to understand how the pivot table functioned because I was able to play around with them in order to see how they could be manipulated to reach a desired outcome. 

### Outcomes. 

#### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date.

The biggest outcome shown through this analysis is the seasonality of the successful outcomes. Beginning in February the success rates start improving and reach an eventual peak in May. The success rates then drop off steadily. Failed rates remained fairly steady throughout the year, although they have a spike of fail rates in October. Understanding these seasonal trends could be highly valuable information for the client. 

#### Outcomes based on goals. 

I was unable to get my data to flow through to the graph correctly and it did not match the graph provided. I was unable to identify why my data points deviated about midway through the data set. Analyzing the graph provided It is important to note that in general the success rates steadily decline as the amounts increase. However, there is an opportunity for success for the client because the success rates have a range between $30,000 and $44,999 in which they have higher rates of success and may be an opportunity for them to take advantage of. 

#### Summary of limitations. 

The limitations of these analyses is that the examined minimal elements at a time. There may be the possibility of multiple elements at play and the analysis would be improved by expanding the range of factors to see which other factors may be influencing the data as opposed to seasonality or pricing points. Additional analysis would be helpful for both by expanding the X axis elements to see if data could be expanded to see if the scale could reveal further useful data.
